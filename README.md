Mapping Earthquakes Challenge

For this challenge we created earthquake maps with three different map styles and three layers with various earthquake data tracked over a 7-day period. Layers include all reported earthquakes, major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5, and their spatial relation to tectonic plates.

The end result produced an interactive mp which each layer nd thre different map styles for the user to navigate through. The below screenshot provides an example of the interfaces:
